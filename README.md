Ok so I'm stuck on the 6th homework assignment, Advanced Loops. Ive been going at it for a full day now and its really starting to discourage me lol. I cant seem to figure out how to implement the tutorials script into a function without it returning the prints all lopsided and they only seem to work with the exact parameters that were in the video. Ive made several other attempts to completely rewrite the script, but I dont understand why its doing what its doing. The goal is to create a game board using loops nested inside eachother and to have the user be able to input theyre own parameters for the amount of rows and columns in the function call.
